            <h3>Programs created to conserve water</h3>
          <p class="title">Jal Shakti Abhiyan - India</p>
          <p class="program-desc">The Ministry of Jal Shakti under the Indian government launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in 2019. It is a nation-wide water conservation campaign that aims at encouraging citizen participation to promote water conservation at the grassroot level. The project on water conservation was launched in two phases from July 1st 2019 to September 30th 2019 and from October 1st 2019 to November 30th 2019.
            On the World Water Day, March 22nd 2021, the government launched the ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain’ (JSA:CTR) with the theme ‘Catch the rain, Where it Falls When it Falls’. It covers rural and urban areas of all districts in India, during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period, up to 30th November 2021.
            Under the campaign, the government focuses on creation/ maintenance of water conservation and rainwater harvesting structures, renovation of various traditional water bodies tanks, reuse and recharge of bore wells, watershed development and intensive afforestation.</p>
          <p class="title">Jal Sanchay - India</p>
          <p class="program-desc">The Jal Sanchay project was a water conservation initiative that was started in Nalanda district of Bihar. The water conservation project focused on constructing check dams, and desilting and renovating the irrigation system and traditional water bodies. It also involved increasing awareness about traditional water conservation and rainwater harvesting techniques aimed at maintaining the water table levels. The project also carried out with the support from local farmers and through campaigns.
            In 2017, the project was selected for a national award for excellence under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP).</p>
          <p class="title">Generosity.org - All regions</p>
          <p class="program-desc">Generosity.org is a water organization committed to ending the clean water crisis in developing countries.
            Generosity.org has completed more than 800 water wells in 20 different nations to help them access clean water.
            The team at Generosity.org is inspired daily by corporations – big and small – who decide to integrate social good into their daily operations. With current partners such as Gululu, Corkcicle, Drink More Good, Ollie & Otto, Neon Own, and more – Generosity.org has seen businesses adopt the clean water crisis as part of their mission. From sponsoring events like #GivingTuesday with matching gifts to donating a percentage of sales from a Generosity.org specific coffee – Generosity.org's corporate partners develop unique and creative ways to give back that make sense for their personal business models and the culture of their companies.
          </p>
          <p class="title">Pure Water for the World - Central America & Caribbean</p>
          <p class="program-desc">Pure Water for the World focuses on communities in Central America and the Caribbean as a water organization that provides children and families with the tools and education to develop sustainable water, hygiene, and sanitation solutions.
            We love how they directly connect fundraising dollars to impact. This immediately helps potential supporters see how their donation or peer-to-peer fundraising campaign will make a difference for the people they serve.

To date, Pure Water for the World has partnered with more than 750 communities throughout Haiti and Honduras. They provide critical resources and education to ensure that safe water, improved sanitation, and adequate hygiene are pillars of their communities.
