            <p>Water is a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have originated in the aqueous solutions of the world’s oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions, such as blood and digestive juices, for biological processes. Water also exists on other planets and moons both within and beyond the solar system. In small quantities water appears colourless, but water actually has an intrinsic blue colour caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths.</p>
        <p>Water can be used for direct and indirect purposes. Direct purposes include bathing, drinking, and cooking, while examples of indirect purposes are the use of water in processing wood to make paper and in producing steel for automobiles. The bulk of the world's water use is for agriculture, industry, and electricity.</p>
        <p>Without water, many companies and the products they provide would fail to exist. Water use is a fundamental commodity for nearly every step of the manufacturing and production processes around the world. Whether it's deionised water for electronics and pharmaceutical sectors, or softened water for boiler feed applications, water is necessary and comes embedded in the footprint of virtually item created on the planet. And to put it into perspective: industry accounts for around 40% of total water abstractions. Yet, at the same time, many global companies have manufacturing facilities operating in water scarce parts of the world, with over two thirds of companies now reporting exposure to water risks. </p>

        <section class="depletion about-water">
            <p>Groundwater depletion is a serious threat to the environment. The majority of our bodies and the Earth is made up of water. We may see the beautiful, flowing surface waters that make up the oceans, lakes and rivers, but this water is not always safe for consumption and is much more difficult to filter than groundwater. Consequently, water from the ground is especially valuable. Groundwater is something that we need all over the world. Humans and animals need water in order to survive as our bodies could not function without it. We also need water to assist us in growing crops, powering equipment, and to keep us comfortable. Societies require much more clean water than we are afforded from precipitation and surface water, which is why groundwater is used so frequently.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">CAUSES OF GROUNDWATER DEPLETION</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Groundwater depletion most commonly occurs because of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. We pump the water more quickly than it can renew itself, leading to a dangerous shortage in the groundwater supply. As a growing world with a population that continues to rise, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the more difficult it is for the groundwater to provide us with the amount of water that we need.</li>
                <li>We continuously pump groundwater from aquifers and it does not have enough time to replenish itself. Water flows freely through the saturated rocks known as aquifers. There are large and small aquifers, and they are the underground water reserves that absorb water and hold it, enabling us to pump it for use. The amount of water that aquifers hold is beyond impressive and can provide us with billions of gallons of water per day. While this amount of water seems plentiful, groundwater is a major contributor to the Earth’s freshwater supply and is responsible for providing up to 40% of freshwater in the world. Therefore, it doesn’t have the ability to recollect quickly enough to be continually sourced for our use.</li>
                <li>Agricultural needs require a large amount of groundwater. It’s frightening to think that there isn’t very much groundwater left when you consider how much water we use on a daily basis to support our population of billions and our personal lifestyles. A large amount of groundwater goes to farming, but the availability of groundwater is steadily declining. Without it, it will be extremely difficult to provide drinking water and water for crops and animals that would help communities during times of drought. The less water that is available, the less food we have and we will be faced with the issue of great demand and very little supply.</li>
                <li>Groundwater depletion can also occur naturally. The problems we would face with freshwater shortage is sure to cause problems in every aspect of our lives. The activities that lead to groundwater depletion come mostly from humans, but a portion of it also comes from changes in our climate and can speed up the process.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="subtitle">EFFECTS OF GROUNDWATER DEPLETION</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Groundwater depletion will force us to pump water from deeper within the Earth. The more we extract groundwater right below the Earth’s surface, the further down we have to go in order to get more. As we have to extract water from deeper within the Earth, we find that there is less water available. Consequently, we will have to use even more resources to develop alternative methods to reach further into the ground.</li>
                <li>Saltwater contamination can occur. We may pump groundwater instead of sourcing it from lakes and rivers, but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t connected to larger bodies of water. Groundwater that is deep within the ground often intermingles with saltwater that we shouldn’t drink. When freshwater mixes with saltwater, it is called saltwater contamination. This sort of contamination would raise the prices of drinking water for everyone because it will cost much more to pump and filter.</li>
                <li>As large aquifers are depleted, food supply and people will suffer. The depletion of the Colorado River and the Ogallala aquifer serve as examples of large groundwater reserves that are being depleted, despite how necessary they are to our economy and well-being. The Ogallala aquifer has been collecting groundwater for thousands of years, and its water resources have to be shared among farmers and citizens.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="subtitle">SOLUTIONS TO GROUNDWATER DEPLETION</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As individuals, one of the things we can do to make a difference is to use less water for luxury purposes. We must all address the issue of groundwater depletion. Considering the impending crisis of a mass water shortage, everyone should do their part to use less water whenever possible. Water is used so freely that it is often part of outdoor decor ideas and used for major attractions, such as amusement parks. Throughout countless neighborhoods, large amounts of water are used for swimming pools while water hoses are kept running to wash cars and for other miscellaneous reasons. We conserve water when we turn off the faucet and reduce our usage of washing machines, dishwashers and similar appliances. Also, we save a massive amount of water by deciding not to use water for decorative and unnecessary reasons at home.</li>
                <li>We should reduce our use of chemicals and dispose of them properly. Many people are not paying attention and are simply unaware of how important it is to keep pollution from occurring beneath the ground. The water from businesses and private residences that run into the streets and sewage systems are commonly laden with chemicals. These chemicals find their way into larger bodies of water and absorb into the ground, poisoning animals and the soil. By using less chemicals and discarding of them carefully, we keep them from adding toxic materials into our water supply.</li>
                <li>One of the most effective ways to address the issue of groundwater depletion is to find alternative sources of water. Alternative water sources can be used to help replenish aquifers. Deriving water from other sources would also give aquifers time to refill instead of pumping too much water from them at once.</li>
                <li>The pumping of groundwater should be regulated. If we don’t have a better understanding of our groundwater supply, then we can easily use much more than we should. Understandably, more funding should be granted towards researching our groundwater supply instead of just pumping the water, so that we can set limits and better pace our usage. Additional funding should be given to support initiatives that not only study the supply of groundwater we have, but also seek to find sustainable ways to use less of it.</li>
