            <p>Ever wondered how AQUIFY selects blogs as "publish-able"? No worries,
                you can do it! AQUIFY considers blogs which have immersing and 
                interesting content, so here's how you can make your blog post just
                like that!
            </p>
            <p class="step">Step 1. Think of a topic</p>
            <p class="desc">Thinking of a topic is not that hard right? WRONG!
                Thinking of a topic is the key to writing a READABLE blog. In 
                AQUIFY, anything related to water should be your main priority for 
                a topic. Let's take an example - "Is water overrated?". Although
                it is not the best example, it surely intrigues your reader and that
                is something you should never forget to include in your blog title.
                To sum it up - Your title should be intriguing, interesting and it
                should sum up your entire blog in one line.

            <p class="step">Step 2. List down the points you want to include</p>
            <p class="desc">Moving on, after writing your blog title, you want
                to list down all the points you want to state in your blog and organize
                them in order. Make sure that the points are clear, concise and that they
                actually describe your topic. Now you have the key points around which you
                will write your blog.

            <p class="step">Step 3. Write the blog</p>
            <p class="desc">This step seems so simple, but trust me, it is not. 
                Writing a blog is the hardest part after figuring out your title. But do not
                despair, AQUIFY is here to make your prepared! :) 
                <span>Step 3a. Write your introductory</span>
                Make sure you start your introductory with either a story, question or
                any thing that makes the reader want to read more. Let's give you an 
                example introductory on the topic 'Why Saving Water Is Actually Important' - 
                <span class="story">I looked around myself. A bucket of water right next to me.
                    I wondered how many people do not have access to this bucket of water. Are there
                    actually people who haven't had access to water? It was hard for me to imagine.
                    Is saving water actually important?
                </span>
                There is a good example of a introductory to a blog. It makes you want to 
                read more and that is what you should keep in mind while writing an introductory.
                Second, you should remember that your introductory should be simple and it should
                introduce your topic within it.
                <span>Step 3b. Write the body</span>
                Do you remember the points you had written earlier in Step 2?
            Rewrite them in the form of paragraphs now. Ensure that the paragraphs
            are concise and clear to read. Remember - Flowery Words do not make your
            paragraph seem clear, it makes it rather confusing.
            <span>Step 3c. Write your conclusion</span>
            Finally, the main content of your blog is done and now you have to end
            it smoothly. But wait, how can we do that? It is quite easy, actually.
            Here are some phrases with which you can start your concluding paragraph - 
            </p>
            <img src="../../../dist/img/blog-tips.jpg" alt="Tips for writing a good blog">
            <ol>
                <li>To conclude...</li>
                <li>In summary...</li>
                <li>To summarize...</li>
                <li>All points considered...</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="desc">Now that you've written your conclusion, verify
                that it restates your main point and it summarizes your entire
                post well. This is the key to a good conclusion.

            <p class="step">Step 4. Check everything once more</p>
            <p class="desc">There is no explanation needed. Just re-check 
                your work and make sure that there are no transition errors,
                grammatical errors or any errors in general.
            </p>
            <p class="step">Step 5. SEND YOUR BLOG TO AQUIFY!</p>
            <p class="desc">Once you're sure that your blog is "publish-able",
                send your work to our creator: sinha.aishwarya1527@gmail.com. She 
                will check your work herself and publish it for you!
